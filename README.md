# Sorting-Visualiser

The objective of this project is to create a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting
algorithms work.

Project Context :
We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort.
But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we
are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about
these algorithms is visualization.
That’s why we are making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms
work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting
algorithms.

High-Level Approach
• Creating the website's User Interface (UI) using HTML, CSS and enhancing it further
using Bootstrap; without actually implementing any of the app's core features.
• Implementation of animations, effects and core functionalities (sorting algorithms)
using JavaScript.
• Publish to GitHub and host the project live using Netlify.
